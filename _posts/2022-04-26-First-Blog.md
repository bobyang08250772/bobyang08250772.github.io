## First Blog

I've been a developer for nearly ten years but this is the first time it occurs to me I should write a personal blog so everything could be recorded. Someday it may come to my rescue when I scratch my head and rack my brains facing a technical issue.

### This is a header

#### Some T-SQL Code

```python
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```python
# Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

for a in range(10):
    pring(a)
```
